                        <p>Joel suffers from a psychological illness
                        called Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD). It can be very challenging to live with this kind of disability.
                        People tend to get instant panic attacks and paranoia. Because Joel has experienced all of this a lot of times
                        while being in treatment, he stopped believing that therapists could cure him. When he gets out of hospitality
                        he runs away from home in order to cure himself. He lost all trust to any human being, even his beloved parents.
                        In nature he finds peace. It gives him courage to step out into the world and experience a real life. Unfortunately
                        the paranoia continues but stops threw a significant event. He gets cured and returns home.<br>
                        <br>
                        CURE ME is a project I wanted to realise for quite a while. It is my first ever shortfilm 
                        I have done by myself. I can say I am really proud of the outcome.</p>

                <p>It is 2031. The last hacker on this planet makes his way into the dark room, where he fulfills his skill. He is a searched man
                    because he is seen as a criminal. Only he is able to hack and either save or destroy the world. But he does not do it for others. 
                    He enjoys it. Now we have to ask ourselfes, is he bad? And what kind of hacking do we even mean? See for yourself!</p>
