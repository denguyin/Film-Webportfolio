                        <p>Set during the Civil War, three men search for a fortune in gold. One of these men is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a cold-blooded hired killer who was hired by a man to locate his partner who vanished with the gold, but he doesn't tell Angel Eyes why he wants him. But Angel Eyes finds out while looking for the man and tells the man who hired him what he found out. But he kills him so he can get the gold himself. The other two men are Tuco (Eli Wallach) and a guy he calls Blondie (Clint Eastwood). Tuco is a bandit. Blondie captures him and turns him in for the reward. But when Tuco is about to be hung, Blondie saves him and they go off and do it somewhere else. After their latest attempt, Blondie tells Tuco they've taken it as far as they can. He leaves Tuco and doesn't give him his share. Tuco tracks him down and makes walk across the desert. Later, they come across a stagecoach filled with men who are dead wearing Confederate uniforms, Tuco finds a man dying who just happens to be the man for whom Angel Eyes is looking. He tells Tuco about the gold, but before he could tell Tuco where it is, he passes out.</p>

                        <p> So Tuco goes to get some water, but when he comes back, the man is dead. But Blondie is there and Tuco thinks the man told him where the gold is, so he nurses him back to health. They put on the uniforms and take the stagecoach. They come across some soldiers who they thought were Confederate, but were actually Union, so they take them prisoner and bring them to the Fort. Angel Eyes is there, an officer. When he learns Tuco took the identity of the man for whom is looking, he assumes he knows about the gold. So he talks to Tuco and he "gets" him to tell him about the gold, but Blondie is the one who knows where it is. So he brings Blondie to him, but he's not intimidated. So he agrees to take him to where the gold is. So the three of them head off to get the gold. But can they trust each other.</p>
